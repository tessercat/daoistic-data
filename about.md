I'd been reading Daoist poetry
in English
for a while,
but mostly I had no idea
what to make of it.
When I found the
[ctext version](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing "Source code")
of the _Laozi_ online,
I liked how patterned the poems look
in classical Chinese
compared to how vague they seem in English,
so I thought I'd try
learning to read them
in something like the original.
I'm certainly no expert,
definitely not Daoist,
but I like spending time
wondering what they were on about,
and this website
is my expression
of what I think I find there.
