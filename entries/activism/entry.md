# Astroturf Activism

好經大事
變更易常以挂功名
謂之叨
To support the cause,
to do the important work
of schooling the peasants
for karma and clout.
That's just an ego-trip.

專知擅事
侵人自用
謂之貪
But to do the research,
to become an expert in the field
of violating the rights of others,
of claiming them as your own.
That's greed.

見過不更
聞諫愈甚
謂之很
To see the abuse
and not think twice,
to hear the outcry
and double down.
That's privilege.

人同於己則可
不同於己雖善不善
謂之矜
The community agrees,
you'd better affirm,
to disagree in good faith
makes you a bigot.
That's entitlement.
