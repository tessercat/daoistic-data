上德不德是以有德
Most people do the right thing
and keep it to themselves.
下德不失德是以無德
Some people can't do anything
without letting us know.

上德無為而無以為
Most people do nothing
when it's the right thing to do.
下德為之而有以為
Some people need a reason
to do the right thing.

上仁為之而無以為
上義為之而有以為
But when kindness does something,
it does so for nothing,
and when duty does something,
it has a good reason.

上禮為之而莫之應
則攘臂而扔之
So when my cause is righteous and people aren't woke,
I lose something important
when I start making threats and promise the moon.

故失道而後德
I'm lost and I'm not doing the right thing.
失德而後仁
I lack character and I'm not being kind.
失仁而後義
I lack compassion and I'm not being responsible.
失義而後禮
I lack dignity and I'm not righteous at all.

夫禮者忠信之薄而亂之首
前識者道之華而愚之始
是以大丈夫
處其厚不居其薄
處其實不居其華
When the righteous
have a legitimate grievance
but justify violence,
when a prophet
dreams of glory
but leads us to ruin,
that's when moral authority
lies in gratitude, not grievance,
in fact, not fiction.

故去彼取此
So cancel one, claim the other.
