The more I look at the _Daodejing_,
and Daoist poetry in general,
the more optimistic and upbeat it seems,
the more rational and practical.

In the 上下 sayings,
I take 不德 as *not moralizing*,
and 無以為 and 有以為
are something like
*has no reason to do*
and *has a reason to do*.
之 is the something
that does (or doesn't)
need to get done.

The poem riffs on
仁, 義 and 禮,
three of the five Confucian virtues (德).
All of these terms
have fairly standard
interpretations in English
that I've mostly just ignored.
Rectify me as you like.

德 is character.
It's doing the right thing,
and it flows directly from
moral principle (道),
the important something
that we lose and lack (失)
when we start
making threats (攘臂)
and promises (扔).

義 is decency.
It's the dignity and respect
that come from being responsible,
from being kind (仁),
and from doing the right thing (德).

The righteous (夫禮者),
legitimate (忠信) their grievance (薄)
yet violent (亂) their means (首).
The prophet (前識者),
principled (道) their tradition (華)
yet stupid (愚) their means (始 in Wangbi, 首 in Guodian).

In contrast,
wise elders (大丈夫)
reject (去) cynical, destructive solutions (薄)
and welcome (取) healthy, positive ones (厚),
just as they reject utopian fantasy (華)
and welcome fact-based common sense (實).
