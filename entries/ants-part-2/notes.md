I started looking at this passage
because it contains part of an obscure term (數窮)
that also appears in
[chapter 5](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11596 "ctext link")
of the _Daodejing_.
I also looked closely
at a passage in
[Lu Shi Chun Qiu](https://ctext.org/lv-shi-chun-qiu/zhi-du#n23747 "ctext link")
that contains the full phrase (數窮於其下),
and it turned out to be
another warning on the dangers of micro-managing.
The passage goes into some detail
on how meritocracies end up with snarky, exhausted leadership,
and adds a pointed question
that makes me think it's not a stretch
to interpret the full phrase
to mean something like
venting frustration on subordinates
or taking it out on subordinates.

As the beached whale is at the mercy of ants,
the activist prince is at the mercy of 有司,
office holders, bureaucrats, public servants,
maybe the deep state, who knows?
In any case, they eat him alive.

Doing a servant's work impairs a leader's 智,
which I've chosen to interpret as judgement.

The organization the prince leads is the 百官,
the hundred departments, in which the 有司 are employed,
and the word appears again in the punchline
at the end of the chapter.
Since the second half of the chapter
compares the enlightened leader
to a charioteer,
百官 is his team.

The person in question,
what I've interpreted here as prince,
is 人君, a leader of men.
While the word
doesn't necessarily imply gender,
and this passage
applies equally well
to any hierarchical organization of
superior and subordinate,
master and servant,
boss and employee,
I took the liberty
of being specific about gender and rank
to give the passage context
in a feudal past.
