# Being There

善行無轍迹
善言無瑕讁
善數不用籌策
A good education isn't learning by rote,
a good lesson isn't punishment for failing,
a good outcome isn't in data and stats.

善閉無關楗而不可開
Healthy boundaries don't guard the gate, but can't be breached.
善結無繩約而不可解
Healthy relationships don't pledge allegiance, but can't be betrayed.

是以聖人
常善救人故無棄人
常善救物故無棄物
That's because
a good influence
is always willing to help someone so no one gets left behind,
always happy to repeat something so nothing gets forgotten.
是謂襲明
They call it
passing the torch.

故善人者不善人之師
不善人者善人之資
So a good mentor is an expert at helping bad students,
and bad students are the good person's responsibility.
不貴其師
不愛其資
雖智大迷
Not respecting the expert,
not accepting the responsibility,
might seem smart, but they're big mistakes.
是謂要妙
They call it
making the grade.
