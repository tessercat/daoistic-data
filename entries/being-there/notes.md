The five 善 expressions
are very flexible.
Here are a few variations
with an attempt at consistent grammar,
literal in Kroll first edition.

- 善行無轍迹
  Walking well / a good road, no ruts to follow.
  Good conduct, no precedent to emulate.
- 善言無瑕讁
  Speaking well, no fault to punish.
- 善數不用籌策
  Good counting, not using tally rod to predict.
  Good fate, not using lots to predict.
  Good numerology, not using yarrow stalks to predict.
  Crafting well, not using counting rod or bamboo strips.
  Rebuking well, not using counting rod to whip.
- 善閉無關楗而不可開
  Blocking / stopping well, no juncture to block up, but can't be opened / started.
- 善結無繩約而不可解
  Thatching well, no ropes to bind, but can't be loosened.
  Making friends well / a good outcome, no standard to promise, but can't be taken apart.

善救 is an expression that appears in this poem
and in _Guliang Zhuan_,
but nowhere else in ctext.
I take it to mean,
"Happy, willing and able to help."
It's 善 as *good will*.

師 is the *expert*
and 資 is the expert's subject matter.

Both 襲明 and 要妙
appear as compounds
in a handful of passages in ctext.
要妙 is *essential and subtle* in Kroll,
but I've interpreted them both
as verb phrases here.

In _Heshanggong_,
要 is the 微妙 inside 道 (its sacred heart?)
that can be experienced by those who 除情 and 去慾,
but it's inaccessible to those who lust for life,
who can sense only its external ephemera.
