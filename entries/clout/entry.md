# Clout

古之善為士者
微妙
玄通
深不可識
In the old days, the best influencers
were a bit mysterious,
strangely reasonable,
definitely inscrutable.
夫唯不可識
故強為之容
In fact, being so inscrutable
is what made them so compelling.

豫兮若冬涉川
猶兮若畏四鄰
They were careful, like a winter crossing,
and reserved, like respectful neighbours.
儼兮其若容
渙兮若冰之將釋
They were as serious as they were popular,
but chill, like melting ice.
敦兮其若樸
曠兮其若谷
混兮其若濁
They were as true as timber,
as wide as valleys,
as messy as mud.

孰能濁以靜之徐清
孰能安以久動之徐生
Who else would quietly clean up by calming us down,
and who else would quietly steady us by keeping us moving?

保此道者
不欲盈
These days,
people like that
don't care about clout.
夫唯不盈
故能蔽
不新成
In fact, they don't flex
because their superpower is making a difference
without making it about themselves.
