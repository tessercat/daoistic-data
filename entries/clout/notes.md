There's a lot of variation
in this one
between different versions,
especially in the 兮若 sayings.
Words have double meanings,
definitions specific to Daoism,
and entries in the _Yijing_,
so it's obscure,
like the
inaudible,
invisible,
ineffable influence
it describes.

I've been trying to wrap my head around
盈, 蔽 and 新成 for a long time,
and the only constant I've found
is that 盈 contrasts 徐 of the previous saying,
and it's something like the difference between
patience and good will (徐) 
and the arrogance and idealism of power (盈).
