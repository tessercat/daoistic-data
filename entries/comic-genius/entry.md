上士聞道勤而行之
Good students hear about Dao and work hard, but they follow it.
中士聞道若存若亡
Average students hear about Dao and some remember, some forget.
下士聞道大笑之
Bad students hear about Dao and laugh at it.

不笑不足以為道
故建言有之
If it wasn't so hilarious, it wouldn't be Dao,
so here are some of the jokes it plays.

明道若昧
進道若退
夷道若纇
Observing Dao obscures it,
proving Dao refutes it,
sorting Dao scatters it.
上德若谷
太白若辱
Praising De degrades it
and preaching defiles it.
廣德若不足
建德若偷
質真若渝
Developing De depletes it,
supporting De demeans it
and believing denies it.

大方無隅
大器晚成
大音希聲
大象無形
道隱無名
夫唯道善貸且成
A school with no lessons,
a method too subtle to learn,
a lecture too faint to hear,
a metaphor with no meaning,
Dao is a riddle with no answer,
and Dao is only as convincing as it is a good sport.
