This poem makes sense to me
as bad puns
to keep normals and nit-pickers
on board.

The following Kroll vocabulary notes
are meant to support my solution
to what I take as two distinct puzzle grids.

In the 道德 expressions,
若 joins a descriptive complement
to an introductory verb phrase.

- 明道若昧 illuminating, explaining Dao == bedimmed, clouded vision
- 進道若退 advancing Dao == retreat
- 夷道若纇 leveling Dao == a knot
- 上德若谷 exalting De == a valley, chasm, cave, impasse
- 太白若辱 great declaring == humiliating, insulting
- 廣德若不足 broadening De == inadequate
- 建德若偷 building De == contemning
- 質真若渝 adjudging what is really meant to be == changing, renouncing

The 大 and 道 punchline expressions
all describe Dao.

- 大方無隅 big method, technique has no niche, corner
- 大器晚成 big implement, vessel late to finish
- 大音希聲 big sound, voice faint message
- 大象無形 unifying patterns that underlie variegated phenomena have no shape, structure
- 道隱無名 Dao is reticent, obscure, has no names
- 道善貸且成 Dao is good at both absolving, forgiving and causing to conform, reconciling, accommodating

I'm not sure what to make of 大器晚成.
It's a modern saying for something like,
"Great talent takes time to mature,"
but that's out of sync with the irony
of the other expressions.
Cook's _Guodian_ footnotes cover alternatives
曼成, 免成, 慢成, 縵成, 無成 and 勿成,
and summarize the use of 晚成 in _Lushi chunqiu_ as,
"An analogy of how great men undertake great things
only after a long period of preparation and observation,
... [and] that undertakings of great forethought
are unappreciated until after their benefits are realized."
