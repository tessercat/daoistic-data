# Manufacturing Consent

衛嗣君欲重稅以聚粟
民弗安
Prince Si of Way wanted to impose mandatory vaccination,
but people weren't happy about it.
以告薄疑曰
He complained to Boyi.
民甚愚矣
People are so stupid, he said.
夫聚粟也
將以為民也
This vaccine
is for their own damned good.
其自藏之與在於上
If they won't do it for themselves, I'll do it for them.
奚擇
What's the difference, anyhow?

薄疑曰不然
Boyi told the prince, Just stop.
其在於民而君弗知
其不如在上也
If it's every man for himself and you don't organize it,
that's no better than forcing it on them.
其在於上而民弗知
其不如在民也
If you force it on them and people have no choice,
that's no better than every man for himself.
凡聽必反諸己
Remember, governance is all about consent.
審則令無不聽矣
國久則固
固則難亡
Be clear so people know what's expected,
be consistent because this will take a long time,
and be reasonable so it's impossible to argue.
今虞夏殷周無存者
Today, Yu, Xia, Yin and Zhao no longer exist.
皆不知反諸己也
They all ignored consent.
