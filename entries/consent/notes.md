聚粟 is a grain levy, not vaccination,
and 在於 is more like grain *stored by*
民 (peasants) or 上 (their lords).
Otherwise I think my interpretation
is more or less literal.

The key phrase, 反諸己,
is *self-reliance* in Knoblock and Riegel (_The Annals of Lü Buwei_),
but I don't like their somewhat libertarian take on Boyi's response,
though the phrase is close enough to
反求諸己, a Confucian idiom,
for me to like *personal responsibilty*
almost as much as I like *consent*.

Knoblock and Riegel emend 國久 to 國反,
which makes a lot more sense in context,
but I like the triplet of 則 phrases
as advice on how to achieve consent,
so I've kept 久.
