I started looking at this passage
because I was struck by
how close it is
in theme and vocabulary to
[_Daodejing_ chapter 9](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11600 "ctext link").

[King Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wu_of_Zhou "Wikipedia link"),
not George Washington,
was the great hero who overthrew
his tyrannical lord
and set the stage
for a new golden age.
