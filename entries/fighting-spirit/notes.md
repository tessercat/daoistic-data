不肖 is the quality of being
*not like* one's forebears.
A conservative interpretation
would probably take 不肖 as
*unorthodox* or *unconventional*
if not outright *unworthy*.

I think that
若肖久矣
其細也夫
is something like
a subjunctive in English.
*Since (my 道) is an ancient tradition (肖久),
that means it's humble (細), doesn't it?*

I like 持而保之 as a conditional.
*If held dear, then protected by them.*

My riff on 儉 is
economy
moderation
temperance
prudence
*restraint*
self-control
simplicity
frugality
parsimony.

_Mawangdui_ versions of this poem
contrast 為天下先 more clearly with
為成事長 (A)
and 為成器長 (B)
than does Wangbi's 成器長,
and _Han Feizi_ quotes the saying
as it appears in _Mawangdui_ A.
成器 is pretty common in ctext
and seems to be
a vessel or other artifact
fashioned from raw (樸?) wood or jade.
成事 is very common in ctext,
and seems to mean something like *achievement*
in modern Chinese.

舍X且Y is more literally *set aside X in favour of Y*.

天 is arguable, as usual.
