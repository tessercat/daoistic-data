The poem describes 復命
as a meditational process
to achieve insight (明) into human affairs (容)
and to avoid unintended consequences (妄作).

容 is a puzzle.
In Kroll, it's *countenance*.
As a noun,
it's *appearance* or *features*,
and as a verb,
it's *accept*.
In this context,
I wonder if it could mean
something like *phenomenon*,
an observable fact or event.

Given 復命,
I think the 乃 pairs
are meant to be read
as something like,
"*X emerges from and returns to a background state of Y*,"
and when investigating a particular 物/容,
you're meant to recurse through ground states
of a series of polar complements
until you reach the base case
of absolute stillness (靜).

My guess is that
the hierarchy of states given here
is what the poem refers to as 常,
and 公, 王, 天, 道, and presumably 久,
are a meditational focus
to achieve insight into
the situational meaning of 容.

I'm not quite sure what to make of 沒身不殆
except that it's the ultimate 明 into 容.
不殆 is *unscathed* in Kroll,
and 沒身 appears pretty often in ctext
and could mean something like *self-abnegation*.
In any case,
I think it sums up the poem
as an argument from first principles
that you're always better off
not making it about you.
