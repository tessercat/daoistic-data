治人事天
They ushered us onto the galactic stage.
莫若嗇
We couldn't have asked for a better guide.
夫唯
嗇是謂早服
早服謂之重積德
Above all
Vulcans showed us that they're very responsible,
and that responsibility is just a habit of doing the right thing.

重積德則無不克
Once we got in the habit of doing the right thing, we realized that we could accomplish anything.
無不克則莫知其極
Once we could accomplish anything, we discovered the law of unintended consequences.
莫知其極可以有國
Actions have consequences, so we established the Federation.
有國之母可以長久
We follow the Federation's directives, so we live long and prosper.

是謂深根固柢
長生久視之道
They showed us that deep commitment and steady character
are the Vulcan way of prosperity and progress, longevity and logic.
