This is one of a few poems
that address the reason
that government exists.
So far,
this is the only one I'm aware of
that seems to offer a logical argument.

It goes something like this.
If we're conservative 嗇,
we make do 早服,
and we collect a lot of De 重積德.
With enough good will 重積德,
there's nothing we can't accomplish 無不克,
but we have no idea yet what kind of havoc our accomplishments will wreak 莫知其極.
That's why we have government 有國,
and human beings grow and last 長久
when we follow a motherly Dao of how to govern our actions and their consequences 有國之母.

Sarah Queen says that
早服 is *early to submit*,
重積德 is *repeatedly accumulate potency*,
and she points out that _Han Feizi_ says that
母 of 有國之母 is 道.
They were my key
to unlocking this poem.
She also mentions that
嗇 seems a lot like 儉 from
[Three Treasures](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11658 "ctext link").

and Translation of _Han Feizi_ Chapter 20, *Jie Lao*,
and Chapter 21, *Yu Lao*",

The 德 of 重積德 is missing from _Mawangdui_.
Laozi's utopia is a land of steady habits.

[The previous chapter](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11649 "ctext link")
introduces 知其極
as the punchline to
禍兮福之所倚 福兮禍之所伏,
companion saying to
[The old man lost his horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_old_man_lost_his_horse).
Success builds on failure,
disaster hides in luck.
Who knows what fate has in store?

According to Kroll,
長生 is *long life*
and 久視 is *enduring vision*.
