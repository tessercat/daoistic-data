# All the World's a Stage

大道汎兮
Dao is so versatile!
其可左右
She can act and direct!

萬物恃之而生而不辭
Everything exists because of her,
and she conjures us,
but not to adore her.
功成不名有
When the story ends,
we don't even know her name.

衣養萬物而不為主
She nurtures and provides for us
and we don't even notice.
常無欲可名於小
Objectively,
you could say that we take her for granted.

萬物歸焉而不為主
Everything happens because of her
and we don't even notice.
可名為大
You could say she's the star of the show.

以其終不自為大故能成其大
Ultimately,
she tells great stories
because she doesn't sing her own praise.
