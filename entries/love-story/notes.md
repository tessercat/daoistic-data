This is one of a few poems
that address 大道 directly,
and in this one,
true greatness is anonymous
and goes unnoticed.

常無欲 is an expression from
[chapter 1](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11592 "ctext link")
that describes the objective state beyond desire
that lets us 以觀其妙,
observe its subtleties,
as opposed to 常有欲,
the subjective state of longing
that 以觀其徼,
gives it meaning.

It's a love story.
