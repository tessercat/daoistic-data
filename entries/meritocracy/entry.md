# Meritocracy

人主自智而愚人
Some managers think they're the smart one and everyone else is stupid.
自巧而拙人
They think they're the expert and everyone else is incompetent.
若此則愚拙者請矣
巧智者詔矣
With a boss like that, idiots ask questions
and the guru explains.

詔多則請者愈多矣
請者愈多
且無不請也
But when the boss explains, people ask more questions,
and questions become even more questions,
and eventually, people ask about everything.
主雖巧智
未無不知也
以未無不知
應無不請
其道固窮
Even if the boss really is a genius,
it's impossible to know everything,
and since they don't know everything,
but people ask about everything,
the only way forward is to fail.

為人主而數窮於其下
將何以君人乎
If you're a boss like that and blame followers for failing,
how does that make you a good leader?
窮而不知其窮
其患又將反以自多
When you've failed and don't know you've failed,
every mistake turns back on itself and creates more.
是之謂重塞之主
無存國矣
They call you the meddling boss
of a dead-end team.

故有道之主
因而不為
責而不詔
That's why masters of the road ahead
encourage us but don't do it for us,
inspire us but don't explain.
去想去意
靜虛以待
They reject belief, reject theory,
prepare by staying still and empty.
不伐之言
不奪之事
They don't criticize
and they don't demean.
督名審實
官使自司
They set terms, establish facts,
and let apprentices take it from there.
以不知為道
以柰何為實
They follow the road in ignorance,
let facts speak for themselves.

堯曰若何而為及
日月之所燭
Yao showed us how to transfer power
over everything lit by the sun and moon.
舜曰若何而服
四荒之外
Shun showed us how to take responsibility
for everything within the four frontiers.
禹曰若何而治青北化
九陽奇怪之所際
Yu showed us how to organize the north-east and fix
everything from Jiuyang to Qiguai.
