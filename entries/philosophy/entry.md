# The Philosophy of Heaven and Earth

Laozi said that
drums make sound because they don't muffle sound,
and mirrors reflect light because they don't absorb light.
Bells make sound but don't ring till they're struck,
and flutes make music but not till they're played.
So the wise are responsible and don't play any tunes.
When there's work to do, they get it done. When something happens, they respond.
老子曰
鼓不藏聲故能有聲
鏡不沒形故能有形
金石有聲不動不鳴
管簫有音不吹無聲
是以聖人內藏不為物唱
事來而制物至而應

The universe is in constant motion.
Ancient because every ending is a new beginning,
vast because it circles back to where it started,
flawless because it moves indivisibly as one.
天行不已
終而復始故能長久
輪復其所轉故能致遠
天行一不差故無過矣

When energy rains down from the heavens, energy rises up from the earth.
Yin and yang flow and mix and life is fair and balanced.
Good people are in charge and tyranny withers and dies.
That's the Dao of heaven and earth.
天氣下地氣上
陰陽交通萬物齊同
君子用事小人消亡
天地之道也

When energy doesn't rain down from the heavens, energy doesn't rise up from the earth.
Yin and yang don't mix and life is desperate.
Tyrants gain power and good people get killed.
Crops don't grow and Dao De compensates.
天氣不下地氣不上
陰陽不通萬物不昌
小人得勢君子消亡
五穀不植道德內藏

Dao of the heavens eases pressure and fills empty space.
Dao of earth erodes the heights and fills the hollows.
Dao of gods frightens the comfortable and helps the oppressed.
Dao of man hoards and doesn't help.
Dao of the wise is humble but nothing could be higher.
天之道損盈益寡
地之道損高益下
鬼神之道驕溢與下
人之道多者不與
聖人之道卑而莫能上也

Every corner is lit when the sky is bright and the sun shines.
The middle realm is at peace when the sovereign is enlightened and ministers shine.
The realm can grow and last when it has all four lights
to enlighten those who shine the light, to enlighten their progress.
天明日明而後能照四方
君明臣明域中乃安
有四明乃能長久
明其施明者明其化也

Universal Dao makes the laws and earth Dao obeys them.
Unity balances them and time connects them.
Life is mature when it recognizes Dao.
Great Dao is wide and easy. If we leave it behind, it's not far.
We manifest its character when we cultivate it within.
We sustain its character when we practice it with others.
天道為丈地道為理
一為之和時為之使
以成萬物命之曰道
大道坦坦去身不遠
脩之於身其德乃真
脩之於物其德不絕

The heavens protect life.
They make us moral and provide for us.
Our souls return to them because they help and don't harm.
Helping and not harming builds character,
so that's how to be moral.
天覆萬物
施其德而養之
與而不取故精神歸焉
與而不取者上德也
是以有德

There's nothing above the heavens nor beneath the waters.
Sky above, water below, the wise imitate them.
Society is stable when we channel their respect and humility.
高莫高於天也下莫下於澤也
天高澤下聖人法之
尊卑有敘天下定矣

The earth supports life and disciplines us.
Our bodies return to it because it gives and takes.
Give and take is low character,
and the least moral don't escape morality,
so that's how to be immoral.
地載萬物而長之
與而取之故骨骸歸焉
與而取者下德也
下德不失德
是以無德

The earth is stable and calm because it embodies the heavens.
Life forms when the earth is stable and calm,
and life gathers when the earth is generous and rich.
Stable and calm, it's never unreasonable.
Generous and rich, it's never intolerant.
地承天故定寧
地定寧萬物形
地廣厚萬物聚
定寧無不載
廣厚無不容

When earth power is rich enough,
fresh water joins the gathering.
Earth Dao can grow and last because it's predictable and generous.
The wise imitate it.
They're moral, never intolerant.
地勢深厚
水泉入聚
地道方廣故能久長
聖人法之
德無不容

Yin resists yang and life prospers.
Yang accepts yin and everything settles down.
When something is prosperous, it's never ungrateful.
When it settles down, it's never unhappy.
When it's happy, it's never upset.
陰難陽萬物昌
陽服陰萬物湛
物昌無不贍也
物湛無不樂也
物樂無不治矣

When yin destroys, yang adapts.
Yin advances, yang retreats.
Tyrants gain power and good people escape unharmed.
That's universal Dao.
陰害物陽自屈
陰進陽退
小人得勢君子避害
天道然也

Positive energy motivates everything to settle down and take its place,
so the wise follow yang Dao.
When we follow something, it follows us,
and when we resist something, it resists us,
and that's why we can't forget its true nature.
陽氣動萬物緩而得其所
是以聖人順陽道
夫順物者物亦順之
逆物者物亦逆之
故不失物之情性

Rice patties fill when the rhythm of life matures,
and canals drain when life has no rhyme or reason.
That's why societies collapse when the rains don't come.
洿澤盈萬物節成
洿澤枯萬物無節養也
故雨澤不行天下荒亡

Yang is lord of life because it rises up and comes back down.
It can find its way back to where it started because it doesn't last long.
It can grow and last because it returns to where it began.
It's the mother of civilization because it can last so long.
陽上而復下故為萬物主
不長有故能終而復始
終而復始故能長久
能長久故為天下母

We can give again and again when we limit positive energy,
and we can change over and over when we collect negative energy.
But nothing can ever change without limits and potential,
and that's why the wise are careful about what collects.
陽氣畜而復能施
陰氣積而復能化
未有不畜積而能化者也
故聖人慎所積

Life thrives when yang eliminates yin,
and life struggles when yin extinguishes yang.
That's why life gets better when the powerful promote yang Dao,
and civilizations die when yin Dao prevails.
陽滅陰萬物肥
陰滅陽萬物衰
故王公尚陽道則萬物昌
尚陰道則天下亡

Life is immature when yang doesn't defer to yin,
and moral change doesn't come when sovereigns don't defer to ministers.
That's why reforms are enlightened when sovereigns defer.
They're blind and deaf when they don't.
陽不下陰則萬物不成
君不下臣德化不行
故君下臣則聰明
不下臣則闇聾

Life teems and multiplies when the sun rises,
and Dao De shines when good leaders are in charge.
Life stops and rests when the sun sets,
and everything runs and hides when tyrants rule.
日出於地萬物蕃息
公王居民上以明道德
日入於地萬物休息
小人居民上萬物逃匿

Life stirs to the sound of thunder,
and life blossoms in the patter of rain.
The influence of a great leader is something like this.
Yin and yang motivate us to take their rhythm,
and great leaders keep us from losing the beat.
雷之動也萬物啟
雨之潤也萬物解
大人施行有似於此
陰陽之動有常節
大人之動不極物

Everything gets nervous when thunder shakes the earth,
and branches fall when the wind sways the trees.
People behave because they're civilized and because great leaders help them let go of anger and be good.
Most people don't like conflict and welcome the relief.
雷動地萬物緩
風搖樹草木敗
大人去惡就善民不遠徙故民有去就也
去尤甚而就少愈者多

When the winds don't blow, fires don't rise,
and great leaders are silent so there's nothing for troublemakers to criticize.
When fires start, they need fuel,
so when great leaders speak, they stick to the facts.
What could go wrong when they're sincere and tell the truth?
風不動火不出
大人不言小人無述
火之出也必待薪
大人之言必有信
有信而真何往不成

Rivers swell with debris from the hills,
mountaintops sink to the sea.
Extra positive energy comes back as yin,
and extra negative energy comes back as yang.
That's why they don't make promises or exaggerate,
and it's why they say it's a good idea not to express frustration or show anger.
河水深壤在山
丘陵高下入淵
陽氣盛變為陰
陰氣盛變為陽
故欲不可盈樂不可極
忿無惡言怒無作色是謂計得

Water flows down when flames rise up,
and the way of the wise helps us cooperate.
Society is harmonious and balanced when the wise are a positive influence.
Civilizations sink and drown in negativity.
火上炎水下流
聖人之道以類相求
聖人偯陽天下和同
偯陰天下溺沉
