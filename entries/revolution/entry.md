持而盈之不如其已
Once you get the hang of it, you quit when you're ahead.
揣而銳之不可長保
金玉滿堂莫之能守
You assume that when you've got it made, it won't take long to fall apart,
and when
gold and jewels deck public halls, that nothing can save your neck.
富貴而驕自遺其咎

When you're rich and powerful, pride brings shame upon itself.
功遂身退天之道
Step up, then step back down, that's how nature works.
