This poem is a close parallel
to a verse in
[Guanzi](https://ctext.org/guanzi/bai-xin#n48540 "ctext link"),
持而滿之乃其殆也
名滿於天下不若其已也
名進而身退天之道也.
The Guanzi verse is part of a passage
that seems to legitimize
[King Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wu_of_Zhou "Wikipedia link")'s
usurpation,
so I'm guessing that this poem
was meant to be read
in the same context,
perhaps as advice on
how to avoid the fate
of the last Shang king.

Conventional translations of this poem
are more literal than my interpretation,
taking the subject of the first line as a cup,
and of the second as a sword or knife.
(Personally, I think the metaphor of the first line
is more likely to be a Zhou
[tipping pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiqi_(tilting_vessel) "Wikipedia link").)
I prefer to read the 而 phrases as
verb phrase conditionals,
and to interpret 持 as *bear in mind*,
揣 as *infer*
and the subject as 天之道.
I also like the 金玉 line
as a second *then* statement
that also matches 揣.

The poem's _Heshang Gong_ title is
運夷, *revolving evenly*.

天之道 as *nature* is a stretch,
but interpreting 天 is always a stretch,
so why not?
