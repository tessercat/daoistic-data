# The Right Thing

載營魄抱一
能無離乎
Hop on and hold tight.
Don't let yourself get left behind.

專氣致柔
能嬰兒乎
Save your energy and relax.
Let yourself be a newborn child.

滌除玄覽
能無疵乎
Wash away your darkest thoughts.
Don't let yourself get upset.

愛民治國
能無知乎
Love your neighbour and lend a hand.
Don't let yourself judge.

天門開闔
能為雌乎
The universe shifts and slides.
Let yourself take it all in.

明白四達
能無知乎
生之畜之
生而不有
為而不恃
長而不宰
Clear and bright in every direction,
don't even let yourself think
about how we're
created and compelled
to give birth but not to own,
to motivate but not mother,
to parent but not punish.

是謂玄德
This one's called Xuande,
the strange case of doing the right thing.
