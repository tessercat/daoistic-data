This is probably
a pithy primer
on the process
and epiphany
of Daoist meditation.

天門開闔 has something mystical to do with,
"Cosmic gates opening and closing,"
and 能為雌 is,
"Letting yourself be made female."

明白四達 evokes for me
a passage in _Wenzi_
that every corner is lit
when superiors defer to subordinates.
I'm thinking of it
as the clarity of purpose
of a common effort.

生為長 vs 有恃宰
is just unbelievably flexible.
If I were to apply
its lesson in Dao De natural law
to Laozi's water buffalo,
he raised her but doesn't own her,
he guides her but she doesn't need him,
he fattens her but not for slaughter.
