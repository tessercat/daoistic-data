What I've interpreted here as "teacher"
is actually 士 (shì),
something between
a priest and a knight.
In healthy societies, 士 were public servants,
members of a literate manager class,
and though "teacher" isn't strictly accurate,
it's not too far from the mark,
and I know a few teachers
who can appreciate the sentiment
expressed here.
