知 is *know*, a verb,
but can be *knowledge*, a noun.

知不知 is
realizing that you,
or someone else,
might not know
what you're talking about.
Either is fine.
Ignorance is our default state,
after all.

不知知 is
not acknowledging this realization (of ignorance).
It's the arrogance of trolls and believers.

病 is *illness* or *fault*
as a noun,
or *troubled by*
as a verb,
and 病病 is *troubled by illness or by making mistakes*.

So it's a warning.
Ignorance is fine,
but ignorance and arrogance
get us in trouble
when we mess with the unknown.
