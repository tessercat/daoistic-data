# Unbegun

道沖而用之
Laozi's way empties and exhausts us.
或不盈
It's not something that empowers us.

淵兮
似萬物之宗
Like a vortex,
generations of living creatures.
挫其銳
解其紛
和其光
同其塵
It dulls our sharp edges,
loosens tight knots,
dims bright lights,
settles thick clouds of dust.
湛兮
似或存
Like an instinct,
something that helps it survive.

吾不知誰之子
象帝之先
Child of who knows what,
eldest of the elder gods.
