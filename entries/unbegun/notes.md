The title is 無源 from
[_Heshanggong_](https://ctext.org/heshanggong/4 "ctext link").

Every English translation I've seen
describes 道 as *empty* (沖)
and 用 is our *use* of it.
Here,
沖, 用 and 盈 are verbs,
the object of each is 萬物,
and all three
complement the 其 sayings
as 道's entropic balancing, moderating effect.

Given 宗, 存, 子 and 先,
another theme of the poem
is something like *evolution*.

In _Heshanggong_,
the 其 sayings are advice.
Sharp edges (銳) are
the desire for worldly success,
fame and fortune,
which should be discouraged.
Tangled knots (紛) are grudges,
which should be resolved
by meditating on 道's
unbiased,
hands-off approach (無為).
Bright lights (光) are
true believers
who should learn
to keep their lamp under a bushel,
or at the very least
not threaten people with violence.
Finally, 同 is *fellowship*.
It's about living in the real world
with everyone else,
not keeping yourself separate
and aloof.

I've been more or less literal
with the 其 sayings
except that 同 is more like *equalize*
(as 和 is more like *harmonize*)
and 塵 is a cloud of dust
or maybe a strong, lingering odor.

As if 湛 is *saturated* or *soaked*
and 存 is *keep safe, preserve*.

In pre-Qin and Han ctext,
象帝 appears once in _Laozi_
and once in _Guoyu_,
and in _Guoyu_,
it refers specifically
to ancient sage-king Shun (舜).
In _Laozi_
I think it refers collectively to mythic
[gods and heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors "Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors on Wikipedia")
of the distant past.
