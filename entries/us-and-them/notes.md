I think this poem
tells a story
of long ago and far away,
when human 道 was ascendant,
when people weren't colonizing and exploiting each other,
when the rich and powerful weren't violent, dangerous thugs,
and when normal people
didn't do terrible things to each other to get ahead,
or just to survive,
and acts of kindness weren't heroic,
just a matter of course.

I also think that,
while this poem is a lament,
it's also an affirmation
of the inevitability and immanence
of a human 道
of good neighbours 民
who share the beauty 美 and joy 樂
of peace 安 and contentment 甘.

In the _Yijing_,
往來 is the *back and forth*
of wishy-washy indecision,
of the destructive motion of a violent earthquake,
of the rhythm of well water as seasons change.
Here I think it's what neighbours do
*to and for* each other.
It's our very personal response
to the twists and turns
of the deadly,
inescapable,
invincible,
impersonal forces
that shape us.

無所乘之 and 無所陳之 are,
"There was nothing [towards/against] which
we could [sail/haul/pit]
our [boats/wagons/army]."

復結繩 is *remit talking knots*,
referring to a method of using knotted cords
to keep track of [social obligations and benefits?].
