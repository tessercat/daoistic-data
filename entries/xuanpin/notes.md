孟孫 appears as a student
in other texts,
but only in _Liezi_ as 孟孫陽.
In any case,
I take this passage as
elder Yangzi's advice
to a handsome,
healthy young man
as they chat
by Yangzi's fire.

I started looking at this passage
because it shares the term 貴生 with
[chapter 75](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11666 "ctext link")
of the _Daodejing_.
I'm guessing that these characters,
along with 愛, 身 and 厚,
are part of the vocabulary of
immortality (不死)
and life extension (久生).

In 以俟於死 vs 以放於盡,
if 俟 and 放 are antonyms,
bind and release,
and 死 and 盡 are synonyms,
does the couplet express something like,
Resigned to death,
liberated from destruction?

Xuanpin is 玄牝 of
[chapter 6](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11597 "ctext link")
of the _Daodejing_.
I was thinking of
the last characters of the poem,
其閒,
as the welcoming
ease and comfort of 谷神,
the valley spirit,
the female principle
of Daoist moral physics.
A phoenix seems
a fitting symbol.
